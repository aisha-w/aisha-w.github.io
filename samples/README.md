## writing samples

I focus on clear, concise, and technically-accurate documentation that is fueled by empathy, accessibility, and equity.

Sometimes I visit websites, and [edit their copy](copyedits/README.md). These are good for getting a sense of my proofreading, editing, and organizational sensibilities.

### documentation
