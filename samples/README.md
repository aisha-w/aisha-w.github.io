## writing samples

I focus on clear, concise, and technically-accurate documentation that is fueled by empathy, accessibility, and equity.

All samples are listed in reverse chronological order.

### copyedits

Sometimes I visit websites, and [edit their copy](copyedits/README.md).

These are good for getting a sense of my proofreading, editing, and organizational sensibilities.

### assets

Miscellaneous documents that don't need to be put into separate categories.
