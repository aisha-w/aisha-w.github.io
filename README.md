## about

I focus on clear, concise, and audience-driven documentation that is fueled by empathy, accessibility, and equity. 

I currently write and edit technical documentation for [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com), the standard in RISC-V semiconductor IP.
As part of my day job, I've become very familiar with RISC-V specifications and standards,
support our in-house documentation tools with a bit of Python programming,
and work extremely cross-functionally to provide accurate and organized documentation for our clients and customers.

A collection of some older writing samples are available [here](samples/README.md).

In my free time I'm exploring different forms of fiber art (knit, crochet, embroidery, sewing), tending to my collection of indoor and outdoor plants, and going on urban hikes of my native SF.
