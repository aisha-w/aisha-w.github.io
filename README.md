## about

I focus on clear, concise, and audience-driven documentation that is fueled by empathy, accessibility, and equity. I currently write and edit technical documentation for [SiFive](https://www.sifive.com).

A collection of some writing samples are available [here](samples/README.md).

In my free time I'm exploring [freeform crochet](https://cypresstextiles.net/2019/05/29/freeform-crochet-basics-the-ultimate-beginners-guide-featuring-abstract-blocks-and-much-more/), discovering childhood piano skills that are still embedded in muscle memory, and going on urban hikes of my native SF.
