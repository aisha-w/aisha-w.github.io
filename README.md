### About

I focus on clear, concise, and audience-driven documentation that is fueled by empathy, accessibility, and equity. I currently write and edit technical documentation for [SiFive.](https://www.sifive.com)

See a collection of some [writing samples](samples/README.md).
Or, view my [documentation contributions](https://github.com/aisha-w).

In my free time I'm exploring freeform crochet, shaking out old piano skills of the past, and going on urban hikes of my native SF.
