I created this site as a way to familiarize myself with GitHub, which has introduced me to the field of technical writing and documentation.

I still have a lot to learn. In the meantime, see a collection of some [writing samples](samples/README.md).
Or, view my [documentation contributions](https://github.com/aisha-w).
