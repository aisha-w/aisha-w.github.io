I created this page as a way to familiarize myself with GitHub, which has introduced me to the field of technical writing and documentation.
I still have much to learn; but in the meantime, see a collection of some [writing samples](samples/README.md).
Or, view my [documentation contributions](https://github.com/aisha-w).
